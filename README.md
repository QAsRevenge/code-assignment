## Objective

- Develop a REST API that reads information about products from database. You can use C#, JavaScript or GO. You can use any database engine.
- Develop a frontend for it using React or any other library you prefer.
- You can use any libraries or tools you prefer.
- Publish your project to Github and be ready to share it. Preferably keep git history of your work. - Share link to Github one working day before interview to recruiter.

## Data model

The database should be capable of storing information about the following entities:

- _Product_
  Each product should have a Name (text), a Product Type, and multiple associated Colours. - _Product Type_
- _Colour_
  For example, a Product with id = 1 could have Product Type = Sofa and Colours = Blue, Ruby. You may add additional tables and columns as needed.

- Create a New Product: A page to create a new product.
